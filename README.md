## Introduction

**SkinAI** leverages the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and integrates a machine learning service to provide users with insightful analysis of their skin conditions based on uploaded images. 

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login.
- **Image Upload**: Upload images of skin for analysis.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Analyze uploaded images using a trained machine learning model.
- **Detailed Reports**: Provide users with detailed analysis reports and preliminary suggestions.
- **History Tracking**: Keep track of all past uploads and analysis results for each user.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
